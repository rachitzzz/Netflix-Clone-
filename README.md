The Netflix Clone is a simple web project built using only HTML and CSS to replicate the basic layout and design of Netflix. It includes a responsive homepage with a navigation bar, a movie/show grid, and a footer. The design mimics the Netflix UI with a dark theme, hover effects, and a clean layout. This project is purely frontend-focused, without any functionality like authentication or streaming. It serves as a great practice for improving HTML structure, CSS styling, and responsive design techniques.
